## go-unit-test-example
Example showing common unit testing patterns for Go. The example used was derived from Andrei Avram's blog about unit testing interfaces: https://blog.andreiavram.ro/golang-unit-testing-interfaces/

I took his example and applied the patterns he mentioned in the blog to achieve 100% test coverage.
